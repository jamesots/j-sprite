**j-Sprite** is a Java based program that will sprite images together and generate the css to display those images.  It can:

  * take a list of files or a directory (with optional regular expression filename filter)
  * recursively search sub-folders (with option to look in hidden folders)
  * generate the css styles in a new file, or append to an existing css stylesheet
  * generate a test HTML file showing all of the "sprited" images.
