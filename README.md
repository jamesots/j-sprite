j-Sprite
========

j-Sprite is a Java based program that will sprite images together and generate 
the css to display those images. It can:

- take a list of files or a directory (with optional regular expression filename filter)
- recursively search sub-folders (with option to look in hidden folders)
- generate the css styles in a new file, or append to an existing css stylesheet
- generate a test HTML file showing all of the "sprited" images.

This is not my project

This is not my project - I have imported it into Git from https://code.google.com/p/j-sprite/
